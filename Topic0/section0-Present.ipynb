This data will be given to you in the form of a dictionary where the *keys* are numbers that reference the movie name and the *values* are lists of the first 5 actors who appear in the credits also represented by id numbers. To practice with this sort of dictionary, I have reproduced a small version below that represents the marvel cinematic universe (as of about 2016). Instead of using id numbers movies titles and actors are just represented by their names as strings."

They allow you to nicely present your code alongside descriptions and discussions. The cells that contain text are written in Markdown.

A straightforward guide to using Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
